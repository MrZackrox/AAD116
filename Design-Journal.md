Design Journal  for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

Put markdown in here + thing wrote on wordpress

Within the first week of Introduction to Communication Design we have started to all ready look at history and the furture of comunication design.

We started to look at a program called <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> as this is new and its a very good text editer that you can use. I have done code before but funny enough I found it strange at having an option of which Markdown attributes you use. To get our selfs use to this program we were given a PDF and we had to recreate what it looked like using markdown. As you can see this is what I have done. (you can see below my work what it is meant to look like).

####Ireland's rugged coast yields

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
=====================================

#####by Robert Sténuit

A WILD NORTH WIND lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

>“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called Port na Spaniagh, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:

- A ornamental winged salamander.

* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta.

* Gilded brass dolphin.

* Lapis lazuli cameos.

* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats.

**The Author** : Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in “The Deepest Days”, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

I found this task to ok it wasn't the most challenging but it still took a bit of time and effort to learn the new syntax. Personally I don't mind the syntax, but it took a bit off getting use to but I fell that was more because I have all ready learnt html etc. So it was interesting to see an other why in which you can style text etc for the web.

##Friday Lecture

As all ways the first lecutre was an introduction to the leacutre <a href="https://twitter.com/ElevenThirty">Paul McCormick</a> and an overall look at the modual. So with this modual if you have not all ready guessed, we are looking in to the history of type and design. We are looking at the complete spectrum of of designers that have inspired many others to follow in their footsteps.

With this week we started to look at Dieter Rams as he was lucky to end up were he did. As you see if he didn't design the iconic Braun Radio he would not have been on Jonathan Ive's radar so then he would have not been in the position to design the first iMac. 

![Dieter Rams](http://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Dieter-Rams-and-his-designs.jpg)

A bit about Dieter Rams; In 1995 Dieter was introduced to Niels Vitsoe who at the time was selling furniture when they first met. This is when they came up with the company Vitsoe+Zapf so that they could sell Rams's furniture designs. The Zapf part of the name is from the Otto Zapf the man who introduced Rams and Niels to each other. Thought Zapf left in 1969 so the company simply became Vitsoe. The company then in 1985 got set up in United Kingdom with the help of Mark Adams. Still to this day the company is selling directly to customers in over 40 countries.

Lets go back a bit further and look at Dieter Rams before he was noticed. He was born in 1932 in Germany. In his younger years he was inspired by his grandfather who was a carpenter. So with this inspiration he went down the path of becoming an architect when Germany was getting rebuilt in the early 1950s. Leater on he luckily got a job in Braun when his friend saw it being advertised. He then got hired buy Erwin and Artur Braun after the death of there father. His job was to modernise the interiors of the company. He quickly then became involved in product design and this is were we saw the clear perspex lid on the SK4 radiogram and many other versions used the same type of lid.

At this point he became the head of design at Braun until 1995. Over the years at Braun Rams had many influences into what electrical products look like now and some furniture. He most recent work is used used daily by millions of people world wide and what is this product you might ask? Well it is the range of Apple products that he inspired. He started of by designing the first iMac when Jonathan Ive saw the brilliance in his work (a lot of other people did as well). Dieter Rams will live on for ever but not because he made interesting products but that he has inspired so many people to follow in his footsteps.

This course is trying to show us the importance of history. As we have many examples of famous designers etc that have realised this as well. On of them is Guillermo del Toro, who spent his whole life fixating over content that spans over years before he was born. 

His whole child hood was spent soaking up the knowledge that everyone else was letting pass by. I had a read of the article that you gave us and it made sense to me. As at the moment I am trying to grow as a person but also an artist, typographer and so on.  I have been having the problem of not knowing the past of what I.

Week 2
------

With this week we saw our journey into looking at the history of design start with the first form of art; cave paintings. At the time of the lecture we were told that the earliest cave paintings were in Cantabria, but just a couple of days ago a group of scientist found.

Also with this week I have decided to take advantage of the resources that I have at my disposal. What I mean is that while I am learning I may as well learn all that I can. So from this week on I will have a section were I write about what I have learnt on my own acored. I will mainly be reading books that I get from the library, I have started with a book about typography. The book is called The Fundamentals of Typography and so far it seems like it will be a useful book to read.

So with that the book starts with a insite to were the written letter started. I first realised that there is a lot more to our language than I would have ever imagine. I knew that different countries read in different directions but I never knew that there are four different ways that you can. Most people read the Latin way left to right, but Arabic, Chinese and the Greek Boustrophedon read in different directions. The Arabic read from right to left. The Chinese read down and up this is because it was much easier for them to use there tools (paint brush) to draw the ideograms. Then you have the Greek Boustrophedon which read left, down then right. I went and found an example as I myself did not fully understand how they wrote, but hopefully now you can see what I meant.  (more on this later)

![Greek Boustrophedon](http://etyman.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/boustrophedon-english.png)

The book then goes one to look at Cuneifrom which is the essentially the first language that we know of. Cuneiform was marked onto a wet clay tablet by using a wedge-shaped styles. It developed from about 4,000 BC until about 100 BC in ancient Mesopotamia. Sometimes you saw that cuneiform was written from top to bottom in the early forms but it later changed left to right and this is when the cuneiform sign were turned on their side. They began to die out when other languages started to grow and as the use of Phoenician script increased.

Personal thoughts- So so far I have enjoyed the book and I know that this is an important part of the process to become a "designer". With that I can not wait to start learning terms, line spacing and so on so that I can start to process other fonts etc that I see in day to day life (lets carry on).

With me saying that I have a few new terms that I had sort of heard of but never really payed any attention to them.

<p> We then went onto look at the Golden Ratio. I remember seeing something about the Golden Ratio on Youtube, the video I saw was called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0">Doodling in Math</a>. As you see on the video the Golden Ratio is based on the Fibonacci Sequence, where you start with adding 1+1=2 then 1+2=3 then 2+3=5 and so on. The Golden Ratio is every where you look, its in the human body, art 
				and plants. </p>

This is me trying the Golden Ratio of Youtube as I wanted to see if I could start to spot websites that us it. You do have Twitter which is known of using the Golden Ratio. We then found out that a man by the name of Tim Brown created a <a href="http://modularscale.com/">Modular Scale</a> in which it calculates the scale of you text.
				
We then looked at books because for many years this was the only way to share information with each other. Like everything books were extremely expensive as a person who got the title of a scribe had to make them by hand, which took months to complete one.
				
At this time you have lovely examples of amazing design talent with the illuminated manuscripts that were made. This technique consists of words being surrounded in decoration such as boarders, initials and so on. This type of book making was only for the rich our for special books such as the main Bible for a Church. A very famous book that was done in this style in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells">Book of Kells</a> which about the four Gospels of the New Testament.

##Friday Semiar

With this semiar we got introduced to GitHub. As with anything new it all seemed a bit confussing, but once it was explaind to us what eachthing done it became quite simple to use. With this we need to set up a home page for our selfs so that we can get our work out to the world. 

Once we got the GitHub stuff out of the way and done with now came the task of writing a brief yet interesting tid bit about youself for the home page. For this we were suggested to look at the other many of great designers out there and see how they present them selfs in their bios.

So to start I went to my twitter acount and looked at the designers that I follow. I found it strange that some did not have a bio section. I guess that these are the ones who everyone has heard of so they dont really need to state who they are. Through my reasearch I saw that a lot of them delve into there past, this could simply be were they grew up our what project the done last.

In my case I have decided to leave that infromation out as I fell that people are no

The bio page is meant to be personal so who ever comes to few it is trying to form a connection with you and if this is true would you be better of using key words which most people can relate. Which is what I have seen a lot throught out my research. I find that they will all be different as it depends on the how much space you have to write about yourself.
