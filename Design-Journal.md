Design Journal  for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

Put markdown in here + thing wrote on wordpress

Within the first week of Introduction to Communication Design we have started to all ready look at history and the furture of comunication design.

We started to look at a program called <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> as this is new and its a very good text editer that you can use. I have done code before but funny enough I found it strange at having an option of which Markdown attributes you use. To get our selfs use to this program we were given a PDF and we had to recreate what it looked like using markdown. As you can see this is what I have done. (you can see below my work what it is meant to look like).

####Ireland's rugged coast yields

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
=====================================

#####by Robert Sténuit

A WILD NORTH WIND lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

>“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called Port na Spaniagh, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:

- A ornamental winged salamander.

* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta.

* Gilded brass dolphin.

* Lapis lazuli cameos.

* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats.

*The Author* : Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in “The Deepest Days”, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

I found this 

Then over the next couple of days we got split up into groups to mind map an app. Wha tthis involed was use doing a normal mind map the way you normaly do them. Then once we done that you then done a version were you drew picture that represents, instead of writing out the word. Then once you done this you had to pick two at random and draw a line connecting them. You then had to do this a coulpe of times as you then used this as the base idea of your app. 

With this excersie came an underline message and that is all ways start on paper. The reason for this is becuase its easier to get you thought down on a piece of paper than on screen. With this you will have a better idea as you can brain storm a lot better. I know this as I would have not thought of the app we came up with in a million years but some how we did.

Friday Lecture

As all ways the first lecutre was an introduction to the leacutre <a href="https://twitter.com/ElevenThirty">Paul McCormick</a> and an overall look at the modual. So with this modual if you have not all ready guessed, we are looking in to the history of type and desgin. We are looking at the complete spectrim of of designers that have inspired many others to follow in their footsteps.

With this week we started to look at Dieter Rams as he was lucky to end up were he did. As you see if he didn't design the iconic Braun Radio he would not have been on Jonathan Ive's radar so then he would have not been in the postion to design the first iMac. 

![Dieter Rams](http://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Dieter-Rams-and-his-designs.jpg)

A bit about Dieter Rams; In 1995 Dieter was introduced to Niels Vitsoe who at the time was selling furniture when they first met. This is when they came up with the company Vitsoe+Zapf so that they could sell Rams's furniture designs. The Zapf part of the name is from the Otto Zapf the man who introuduced Rams and Niels to each other. Thought Zapf left in 1969 so the company simply becamse Vitsoe. The company then in 1985 got set up in United Kingdom with the help of Mark Adams. Still to this day the company is selling directly to customers in over 40 countries.

Lets go back a bit further and look at Dieter Rams before he was noticed. He was born in 1932 in Germany. In his younger years he was inspired by his grandfather who was a carpenter. So with this inspitration he went down the path of becoming an architect when Germany was getting rebuilt in the early 1950s. Leater on he luckly got a job in Braun when his friend saw it being advertised. He then got hired buy Erwin and Artur Braun after the death of there father. His job was to modernise the interiors of the company. He quickly then became involved in product design and this is were we saw the clear perspex lid on the SK4 radiogram and many other versions used the same type of lid.

At this point he became the head of deisgn at Braun until 1995. Over the years at Braun Rams had many influances into what electrical products look like now and some furniture. He most recent work is used used daily by millions of people world wide and what is this product you might ask? Well it is the range of Apple products that he ispired. He started of by designing the first iMac when Jonathan Ive saw the brilliance in his work (a lot of other people did as well). Dieter Rams will live on for ever but not because he made interesting products but that he has inspired so many people to follow in his footsteps.

Week 2

With this week we saw our journy into looking at the history of design start with the first form of art cave paintings. At the time of the lecture we were told that the earlist cave paintings were in Cantabria, but just a couple of days ago a group of scientist found.

Also with this week I have decided to take advantage of the resoucres that I have at my disposal. What I mean is that while I am learning I may as well learn all that I can. So from this week on I will have a section were I write about what I have learnt on my own acored. I will mainly be reading books that I get from the libary, I have started with a book about typography. The book is called The Fundementals of Typeography and so far it seems like it will be a usefull book to read.

So with that the book starts with a insite to were the writen letter started. I first realised that there is a lot more to our lanuage than i would have ever imagine. I knew that diferent countries read in different directions but I never knew that there are four different ways that you can. Most people read the Latin way left to right, but Arbic, Chinese and the Greek Boustrophedon read in different directions. The Arabic read from right to left. The Chinese read down and up this is because it was much easier for them to use there tools (paint brush) to draw the ideograms. Then you have the Greek Boustrophedon which read left, down then right. I went and found an example as I myself did not fully understand how they wrote, but hopefully now you can see what I meant.  (more on this later)

The book then goes one to look at Cuneifrom which is the esentualy the first language that we know of. Cuneiform was marked onto a wet clay tablet by using a wedge-shaped styles. It devloped from about 4,000 BC until about 100 BC in acient Mesopotamia. Sometimes you saw that cuneifrom was written from top to bottom in the early froms but it later changed left to right and this is when the cuneiform sign were turned on their side. They began to die out when other languages started to grow and as the use of Phoenician script increased.

Personal thoughts- So so far I have enjoyed the book and I know that this is an important part of the process to become a "designer". With that I can not wait to start learning terms, line spacing and so on so that I can start to process other fonts etc that I see in day to day life (lets carry on).

With me saying that I have a few new terms that I had sort of heard of but never really payed any attention to them.
