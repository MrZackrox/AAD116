Design Journal  for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1
------

Within the first week of Introduction to Communication Design we have started to all ready look at history and the future of communication design.

We started to look at a program called <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> as this is new and its a very good text editor that you can use. I have done code before but funny enough I found it strange at having an option of which Markdown attributes you use. To get our selves use to this program we were given a PDF and we had to recreate what it looked like using markdown. As you can see this is what I have done. (you can see below my work what it is meant to look like).

####Ireland's rugged coast yields

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
=====================================

#####by Robert Sténuit

######*Illustrations by National Geographic Photographer Bates Lilttlehales*.

A WILD NORTH WIND lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to starboard.

>“In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss of almost all her company at a little cove near the *Giants Causeway* still called Port na Spaniagh, ‘the port of the Spaniards’.”

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.

The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, sank into the convulsive surf.

Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, treasures lost on that fateful day included:

- A ornamental winged salamander.

* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta.

* Gilded brass dolphin.

* Lapis lazuli cameos.

* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face.
* Gold ducats.

**The Author** : Veteran Belgin dicer Robert Sténuit spent two days at 432 feet beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in “The Deepest Days”, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.

I found this task to ok it wasn't the most challenging but it still took a bit of time and effort to learn the new syntax. Personally I don't mind the syntax, but it took a bit off getting use to but I fell that was more because I have all ready learnt html etc. So it was interesting to see an other why in which you can style text etc for the web.

##Friday Lecture

As all ways the first lecture was an introduction to the lecture <a href="https://twitter.com/ElevenThirty">Paul McCormick</a> and an overall look at the module. So with this module if you have not all ready guessed, we are looking in to the history of type and design. We are looking at the complete spectrum of of designers that have inspired many others to follow in their footsteps.

With this week we started to look at Dieter Rams as he was lucky to end up were he did. As you see if he didn't design the iconic Braun Radio he would not have been on Jonathan Ive's radar so then he would have not been in the position to design the first iMac. 

![Dieter Rams](http://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Dieter-Rams-and-his-designs.jpg)

A bit about Dieter Rams; In 1995 Dieter was introduced to Niels Vitsoe who at the time was selling furniture when they first met. This is when they came up with the company Vitsoe+Zapf so that they could sell Rams's furniture designs. The Zapf part of the name is from the Otto Zapf the man who introduced Rams and Niels to each other. Thought Zapf left in 1969 so the company simply became Vitsoe. The company then in 1985 got set up in United Kingdom with the help of Mark Adams. Still to this day the company is selling directly to customers in over 40 countries.

Lets go back a bit further and look at Dieter Rams before he was noticed. He was born in 1932 in Germany. In his younger years he was inspired by his grandfather who was a carpenter. So with this inspiration he went down the path of becoming an architect when Germany was getting rebuilt in the early 1950s. Leater on he luckily got a job in Braun when his friend saw it being advertised. He then got hired buy Erwin and Artur Braun after the death of there father. His job was to modernise the interiors of the company. He quickly then became involved in product design and this is were we saw the clear perspex lid on the SK4 radiogram and many other versions used the same type of lid.
  
  ![SK4 radiogram](https://d2lsod3xpjaepj.cloudfront.net/files/assets/1000/254/crops/350.jpg)

At this point he became the head of design at Braun until 1995. Over the years at Braun Rams had many influences into what electrical products look like now and some furniture. He most recent work is used used daily by millions of people world wide and what is this product you might ask? Well it is the range of Apple products that he inspired. He started of by designing the first iMac when Jonathan I've saw the brilliance in his work (a lot of other people did as well). Dieter Rams will live on for ever but not because he made interesting products but that he has inspired so many people to follow in his footsteps.

This course is trying to show us the importance of history. As we have many examples of famous designers etc that have realised this as well. On of them is Guillermo del Toro, who spent his whole life fixating over content that spans over years before he was born. 

His whole childhood was spent soaking up the knowledge that everyone else was letting pass by. I had a read of the article that you gave us and it made sense to me. As at the moment I am trying to grow as a person but also an artist, typographer and so on.  I have been having the problem of not knowing the past of what I.

Week 2
------

With this week we saw our journey into looking at the history of design start with the first form of art; cave paintings. The earliest cave paintings that we know of can be found at Cantabria. Still these cave paintings over thousands and thousands of years old and still have an effect on our life's to day, this is what I think is most amazing about them. You told us that it had a effect on Picasso, but with more research I think it changed his out look on art completely. I found this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/14/AR2006121401459.html">article</a> about him when he saw a cave that later became known as Lascaux, the Sistine Chapel of cave art, which is just a fantastic name. It only says about him in the first paragraph but I just love the quote they have of him. When he saw the cave just after the World War 2 ended, he came out and said "We have learned nothing in twelve thousand years". Reading on down this article I see how amazing cave painting is but telling you would just be me reiterating what I just read, but I would say it is a must read. Here is also an <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1311314/Art-lovers-stunned-pre-historic-cave-paintings-France--lets-hope-know-works-just-copies-real-17-000-year-old-ones-door.html">article</a> with good images of the cave.

Also with this week I have decided to take advantage of the resources that I have at my disposal. What I mean is that while I am learning I may as well learn all that I can. So from this week on I will have a section were I write about what I have learnt on my own acored. I will mainly be reading books that I get from the library, I have started with a book about typography. The book is called The Fundamentals of Typography and so far it seems like it will be a useful book to read.

So with that the book starts with a insight to were the written letter started. I first realised that there is a lot more to our language than I would have ever imagine. I knew that different countries read in different directions but I never knew that there are four different ways that you can. Most people read the Latin way left to right, but Arabic, Chinese and the Greek Boustrophedon read in different directions. The Arabic read from right to left. The Chinese read down and up this is because it was much easier for them to use there tools (paint brush) to draw the ideograms. Then you have the Greek Boustrophedon which read left, down then right. I went and found an example as I myself did not fully understand how they wrote, but hopefully now you can see what I meant.  (more on this later)

![Greek Boustrophedon](http://etyman.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/boustrophedon-english.png)

The book then goes one to look at Cuneifrom which is the essentially the first language that we know of. Cuneiform was marked onto a wet clay tablet by using a wedge-shaped styles. It developed from about 4,000 BC until about 100 BC in ancient Mesopotamia. Sometimes you saw that cuneiform was written from top to bottom in the early forms but it later changed left to right and this is when the cuneiform sign were turned on their side. They began to die out when other languages started to grow and as the use of Phoenician script increased.

Personal thoughts- So so far I have enjoyed the book and I know that this is an important part of the process to become a "designer". With that I can not wait to start learning terms, line spacing and so on so that I can start to process other fonts etc that I see in day to day life (lets carry on).

With me saying that I have a few new terms that I had sort of heard of but never really payed any attention to them.

We then went onto look at the Golden Ratio. I remember seeing something about the Golden Ratio on Youtube, the video I saw was called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0">Doodling in Math</a>. As you see on the video the Golden Ratio is based on the Fibonacci Sequence, where you start with adding 1+1=2 then 1+2=3 then 2+3=5 and so on. The Golden Ratio is every where you look, its in the human body, art and plants.
				
We then found out that a man by the name of Tim Brown created a <a href="http://modularscale.com/">Modular Scale</a> in which it calculates the scale of you text.
				
We then looked at books because for many years this was the only way to share information with each other. Like everything books were extremely expensive as a person who got the title of a scribe had to make them by hand, which took months to complete one.
				
At this time you have lovely examples of amazing design talent with the illuminated manuscripts that were made. This technique consists of words being surrounded in decoration such as boarders, initials and so on. This type of book making was only for the rich our for special books such as the main Bible for a Church. A very famous book that was done in this style in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Kells">Book of Kells</a> which about the four Gospels of the New Testament.

##Friday Seminar

With this seminar we got introduced to GitHub. As with anything new it all seemed a bit confusing, but once it was explained to us what each thing done it became quite simple to use. With this we need to set up a home page for ourselves so that we can get our work out to the world. 

Once we got the GitHub stuff out of the way and done with now came the task of writing a brief yet interesting tidbit about yourself for the home page. For this we were suggested to look at the many of great designers out there and see how they present themselves in their bio's.

So to start I went to my twitter account and looked at the designers that I follow. I found it strange that some did not have a bio section. I guess that these are the ones who everyone has heard of so they don't really need to state who they are any more. Through my research I saw that a lot of them delve into their past, this could simply be where they grew up our what project the done last. In my case I have decided to leave my past out as at this point people don't really need or care about were I grew up as I have offered nothing worth wild to them. I came to this conclusion by looking at <a href="http://j-scott.com/about/">J-Scott</a> who is a very good illustrator and animator.

![Jordan Scott](http://static.squarespace.com/static/51c0e053e4b0fd9e08f59a60/t/53ee5589e4b020d5c7fa6cdf/1408128396100/?format=500w)

The bio page is meant to be personal so whoever comes to few it is trying to form a connection with you and if this is true would you be better of using key words which most people can relate to. Which is what I have seen a lot throughout my research. I find that they will all be different as it depends on the how much space you have to write about yourself. But a lot of people now a days are trying to describe themselves in least amount of words possible. I fell what might be having an effect on this is Twitter and so on, as when you are filling out you bio on then you only have a certain amount of words that you can use.

So this is the way I am looking at it. I want to make my bio small but yet insightful to whom I am as a person but more so a designer. Because this is one thing that I have seen time and time again everyone one all ways writes about their work ethics and so on. But in my case I don't have any yet, but I have all ways stood by one thing in my life and that is if I can inspire one person I will be happy.  

So over all I learnt that you want to give the reader information about your past, but in this intense as I said before I am leaving it out until hopefully one day people will actually want to hear about my childhood etc. The is not that much room so I am deciding on leaving this information out as I want to get down the important stuff. The past does not have to be about you childhood it can even involve past work that you have done, as this is what probably made you a known designer. In my research I saw a lot of designers writing about their past work for example <a href="http://www.justinmaller.com/info/">Jusin Maller</a>. In his about me page he writes about an ongoing project <a href"http://facets.la/">facets</a> that has made him quite popular in the design community. Then on top of that you want to convey what interests you as a person/ designer. This is the way I am going to go with my personal page, I am going to simply state what I like i.e. photography and so on.

I would love to have more room to write more about myself or at least to be able to go into some detail on some of my interests. My <a href="http://mrzackrox.github.io/">about me</a> was longer but I ran into a problem were the background and the box in which the about me text is in overlap. So I had to refine it even more to a few simple lines but I sort of like it. I wouldn't mind a few more lines so that maybe I could say about my characteristics. So as you can see I went with sort of a short introduction to myself with mearly just stating things that I like, I thought it would be good to have what I am studing to represent that course in the outside world.

So over all I would say that I am happy with my about me section but in the future when I start to get more an more content I will turn my interests into links so that people can go an view that certain interest of mine. For example sense I am starting to write a bit I will one day turn "writing" into a link wich takes you to my journal. 


Week 3
------

With a new week begging we started to look at Guttenberg and moveable type. We started of with the printing press as this is what revolutionised how information was spread. I have been a massive fan of typography for a long time now and I have all ways appreciated the level of detail in type. So before I go and write about the history of type I would like to write about a typographer that has inspired me to try it for myself.

Sense I have all ready been keen on typography I have all ready seen a lot's of examples of the amazing talent that's out there. For me I like hand lettering better, I saw this post on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> which just blew my mind and inspired it. The <a href="http://imgur.com/a/h6fss">post</a> was just some typography that this guy done, but for some reason it just mead me fell oddly wired about my self as I questioned my whole being wondering about how good I could be at it. The guy who done typography is called <a href="http://seanwes.com/">Sean McCabe</a>, he is a very talented guy and his work is just amazing. From seeing his work I have all ways tried now and again to do some of type me self but was only ok at it. Though when starting this course I have saw a lot more inspirational things which is making me stick at doing it sort of.

Week 4

Week 5
------

This week we were given a topic to research for a presentation the next week. We were split up into groups of four and given a topic each to research. The group that I am with got the Design System of the Olympic Games as our topic for the presentation. We have ten minutes to present our findings so that means each of us have 2 and a half minutes to talk each.

As a group we have decided to each take an Olympic games each with me being the exception and having two. In my group is  <a href="https://github.com/poppygamble">Poppy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JoshToan">Josh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/amber-mcgregor">Amber</a>, if you click on there names it will take you to their GitHub page, but to see the research that they done click on the AAD116 repository and go down to about week five and you should see what they found out about there Olympics.

At the start I thought we had it the best but the more that I researched the more I found out about little things that inspired the design system of the games. The hardest part for me was choosing what to talk about as there was so much but we have little time to talk about it all so some facts that are in this research did not make it into the final presentation. So I might have left out important parts that should have been in the presentation but what's in the presentation is still relevant to the topic and is also important even though it might not seem like that.

I decided to make my research into sort of a story of the games so what you are reading is more and less what I will be saying in the presentation with more meat to it.

The two Olympics that I am looking at are the Tokyo and Mexico Olympics which both have important roles in the evolution of the design system of the games.

####Research For Presentation on The Design System of The Olympic Games

Tokyo Olympics 1964-

Tokyo was lucky to have the games in 1964. This game was not just important for Tokyo but for the whole of Japan as this event brought it back into the global stage again. The reason for this is because Japan was in disarray still from the war twenty years ago, but this event allowed them to push the infrastructure that we see today into life.  

The two main people behind the successful design of the Tokyo Olympics was Masaru Katzumie and Yusaku Kemekura.

Every aspect of this Olympic games showed a class of design that we had not seen from Tokyo before. You can see this in the posters that were made for the event.

The first one as you can see now have a very iconic look and feel to it. It is said that Yusaku Kamekura forgot when the submission deadline for the a poster was until he got a call informing the deadline was today. He then supposable made this poster in less than two hours. I have no doubt that he could have done that but he probably have a very good idea of what way the poster/logo was going to look like.

The poster uses the iconic red Japanese sun which announces to the world ,"We Are Back" and stamps Japan's identity on the games. You then have the five rings and the text being a gold colour. This can insinuate that Tokyo has wealth and status but also that the games will also be successful. The poster no doubt is very minimalism but it has so much class which Tokyo needed to be seen to have.

There are a few important aspects of the design from this Olympics but the most important is the use of pictograms.  Masaru Katzumie and Yusaku Kemekura saw the importance of making an international standardized signage system.  For this they knew that pictograms would be the easiest way to create this system. 

As they didn't want to have signs for all the different languages for each country as it would be too confusing for the spectators.  So they created the  geometrically stylized pictograms using a square field with a grid.

To start we first need to look at the London Olympic games in 1948. The reason for this because this is when we first saw pictograms being used. As you can see the pictograms that were used look very English with that Victorian style to them with the crest like look about them. And people from other countries might not understand what these stand for. Then on top of this the were not a system of communication but merely an illustation of the events.
 
I also found out that they drew inspiration from Otto Meurath and Gerd Arntz who at the time was creating a info graphic form known as Isotype. 
 
But before I talk about this here is an example of the grid that is similar to what they used but this is for a different Olympic games.
  
As you can see below this is what the pictograms looked like at the games. As you can see they are very basic bold stick figures that only capture the key movements of the sports.

Mexico-

For this Olympics Pedro Ramirez saw that he would need the help of an international design team to create something for this games. So they enlisted the help of these people

For this Olympics they wanted to show the culture of Mexico as the games were being held all over the place and not in just one place. So the design team started to look at Aztec artifices and Mexican folk art, in which they drew their inspiration from for the design of the games. 

For the logo they had a mandatory requirement which was that they needed to use the five Olympic rings. They drew their inspiration from the Aztec artifices that they looked at and you can see here one of the artifices that they were looking at. Then here is the logo for this Olympics.

You can clearly see the link between them but they brought a more modern style to it with the iconic 60's strip look. They had the lines radiating  outwards to signify Mexico as an emitting or expanding centre to the rest of the world. This then evolved into a type face and was used every were from stamps to tickets.

For this Olympics they also had statues outside the events which acted like signs for the attendees. Even the New York Times said that if you couldn't speak any language you could still get about if your weren't colour blind. 

They were lucky to have such an amazing system in place all ready from the Tokyo Olympics. But with this Olympic pictograms the decided to focus on  more of an expressive detail in which some of the glyphs found in Mexican preHispanic cultures.
